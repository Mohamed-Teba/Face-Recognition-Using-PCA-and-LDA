# 😊 Face Recognition Using PCA and LDA 📸

Welcome to the **Face Recognition Using PCA and LDA** project! 🚀 This project leverages **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)** to build a robust face recognition system. By combining dimensionality reduction and discriminative techniques, this system identifies individuals from facial images with high accuracy. 🌟

---

## 🌟 Overview

Face recognition is a key application in computer vision, used in security, authentication, and more. This project uses **PCA** to reduce the dimensionality of face images while preserving essential features and **LDA** to enhance class separability for better classification. It builds on the author's previous work, such as the [Face Detection System](https://github.com/Mohamed-Teba/Face-Detection-System), but focuses on traditional machine learning approaches for face recognition. 📷

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset will likely include:
- **Face Images**: Labeled images of individuals (e.g., LFW, Yale Face Database, or custom datasets).
- **Labels**: Unique identifiers for each person.
- **Metadata**: (If applicable) Image attributes like size or lighting conditions.

*(Dataset details and source will be added once available.)*
